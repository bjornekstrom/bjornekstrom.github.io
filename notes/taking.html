    <h2>Taking a walk in the field of information practices</h2>
    
    <i>2020-01-07</i>
    
    <p>My first year as a PhD candidate in Library and Information Science at the University of Borås, Sweden, is slowly coming to an end. In order to provide an understanding of prominent research articles from researchers in the LIS subfield of <em>information practices</em>, I have for the past year made extensive use of the Web of Science database in order to get a contemporary grasp of the field. In this post, I will try to provide some insights into the procedures of me orientating myself in my field of research.</p>
    
    <p>An initial query was inspired by the one used as a basis for bibliographic visualisations in an article by Pilerot, Hammarfelt and Moring (2017), although amended as the querying processed. The journals sought in were</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><em>Journal of Documentation</em></li>
      <li><em>Information Research</em></li>
      <li><em>The Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology</em></li>
      <li><em>Library Quarterly</em></li>
      <li><em>Library Trends</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The selection was made as these journals, from the earlier mentioned journal article were &ldquo;deemed as major channels for practice oriented studies&rdquo; (Pilerot, Hammarfelt &amp; Moring, 2017).</p>
    
    <p>Several queries were conducted:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>(TS=(&quot;practice&quot; OR &quot;practices&quot; OR &quot;information practice&quot;)) AND (SO=(&quot;journal of documentation&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;the association for information science and technology&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;information research an international electronic journal&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;library trends&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;library quarterly&quot;))</code>.  Refined by: DOCUMENT TYPES: ( ARTICLE ). Timespan: All years. Indexes: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&amp;HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, ESCI. &gt;&gt; 715 entries in Web of Science. Retrieved 29th of October, 2019.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This query lead to the entry list including practice-oriented research within fields such as knowledge management, discourse analyses of the cognitive turn within LIS and digital library evaluation. While interesting as such, many of the terms were deemed irrelevant for the narrower scope of information practice-related research. Another query directed to the field of information practices and information behavior was the following one:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>(TS=(&quot;information practice*&quot; OR &quot;information behavior&quot; OR &quot;information behaviour&quot;)) AND (SO=(&quot;journal of documentation&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;the association for information science and technology&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;information research an international electronic journal&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;library trends&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;library quarterly&quot;))</code>. Refined by: DOCUMENT TYPES: ( ARTICLE ) Timespan: All years. Indexes: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&amp;HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, ESCI. &gt;&gt; 388 entries in Web of Science. Retrieved 29th of October, 2019.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The entries in the list from this query was however disregarded as information behavior – although a prominent research field within LIS studies – often takes a more cognitivist notion on human information handling than the practice-oriented field of information practices. A third query was hence made:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>(ALL=(&quot;information practice*&quot;)) AND (SO=(&quot;journal of documentation&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;the association for information science and technology&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;information research an international electronic journal&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;library trends&quot;) OR SO=(&quot;library quarterly&quot;))</code>. Refined by: DOCUMENT TYPES: ( ARTICLE ). Timespan: All years. Indexes: SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&amp;HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, ESCI. &gt;&gt; 105 entries in Web of Science. Retrieved 29th of October, 2019.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>While this query only presents one search term, it was deemed suitable since information practices is an established term for the body of work relating to this field in particular. The results was used as a basis for the tabulation and visualisation of highly cited journal articles related to information practices. The table below presents the most widely cited authors of journal articles from this query. While citations isn&rsquo;t necessarily - or solely – an indicator of scientific impact, they provide an indication of prominent journal articles related to information practices within LIS. In order to stay up to date with this query through probing, a weekly alert has been instigated from Web of Science to my university e-mail account.</p>

    <p>Figure 1: Citation network for information practice query on articles indexed in Web of Science, 2009-2019.</p>
    
    <p>The entry list was also exported as tab-delimited plain text and visualised through bibliometric network application VOSviewer (see figure above).<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> This was done in order to provide a visual understanding of how authors of contemporary prominent journal articles related to information practices are connected citation-wise. The result can be seen in the figure below, where nodes representing articles by Pamela J. McKenzie (2003), Reijo Savolainen (2007), Annemaree Lloyd (2007) and Lloyd, Mary Anne Keenan, Kim M. Thompson and Asim Qayyum (2013) are prominent citation-wise, much in line with the table above.</p>
    
    <p>This visualisation provides chaining-wise guidelines on which researchers&rsquo; work to follow and how they relate to each other. However, as Björn Hellqvist (2010) discusses, references in the humanities (and to some extent also in the social sciences) may very well serve other purposes than simply endorsements. References can also take the form of negative and contractive purposes in terms of positioning and contexts. While this is important to consider especially in terms of representations of these kinds, network visualisations may provide an outline of how researchers in a certain field cite each other at given times.</p>
