	<h2>On criticism and seminar culture</h2>

      <i>2020-06-12</i>

      <p>Giving and recieving criticism is hard. Oskar Lindwall (2019) describes how the term criticism in mundane circumstances often is understood as pointing out incorrections and flaws while it in scientific contexts has other connotations. At the same time, the difference isn't always crystal clear; Acting defensively and affectively to criticism is common in academia. The context is here of high importance:</p>

      <blockquote>In cases of disagreement it seems hard to fully separate the mundane understanding of criticism from the understanding advocated by the academia. Giving and receiving criticism is hence a complex and ambiguous activity. An utterance "only" thought as an advice, for example a description of how something is perceived and how it could be improved, often does something more than what was intended. <cite>(Lindwall, 2019, p. 229, my translation.)</cite></blockquote>

      <p>This is an insight which I try to keep in mind for future seminars. All practice leads to enhancements of skill, also in relation to future seminars, conferences and network meetings. Participating in seminars also lead to an understanding of the academic meeting as a practice; how roles and turntaking work, implicit rules and norms and how to keep good tone in relation to constructive criticism.</p>
