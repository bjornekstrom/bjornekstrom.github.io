	<h2>On criticism and the seminar culture</h2>

      <i>2020-06-12</i>

      <p>Giving and recieving criticism is a hard. Oskar Lindwall (2009) describes how the term criticism in mundane circumstances often is understood as pointing out incorrections and flaws while it in scientific contexts have other connotations. In the Humanities in particular, its' purpose is to analyze how works can be enhanced cultural experiences while source criticism and critical thinking is a goal in itself for schools as well as for colleges and universities. Acting defensively and affectively to critique is also not something which happens only to students. Researchers can also experience anger or overwhelmence by having one's research findings questioned (Lindwall, 2019). The context is here of high importance:</p>

      <quote>In cases of disagreement it seems hard to fully separate the mundane understanding of criticism from the understanding advocated by the academia. Giving and receiving criticism is hence a complex and ambiguous activity. An utterance "only" thought as an advice, for example a description of how something is perceived and how it could be improved, often does something more than what was intended.</quote> <p>(Lindwall, 2019, p. 229, my translation.)</p>

      <p>This is an insight which I try to keep in mind for future seminars. All practice leads to enhancements of skill, also in relation to future seminars, conferences and network meetings. Participating in seminars also lead to an understanding of the academic meeting as a practice; how roles and turntaking worl, implicit rules and norms and how to keep good tone in relation to constructive criticism.</p>
